To do this, the current situation will be analysed through the use of data on disruptions and delays. This is the data processing part of the project. Then we will build a simulation of the train route between Rotterdam Centraal and Den Haag HS. We will first check the accuracy of the simulation through the use of the real world data on the current situation. Then we will analyse the future situation. Finally, we can compare the future situation to the current situation. "
